We are very happy and proud to be able finally unveil the detailed program of the conference.
We have a wide range of topics, from Computer Vision to Natural Language Processing,
from Machine Learning to MLOps to Robotics
(do not take this categorization too seriously though and go read the talk descriptions ðŸ˜‰).
Check it out [here](../program/)!

Thanks a lot to our wonderful speakers!
For a peek preview we have now published 6 interviews of the speakers and we have plans for more.
Subscribe to ARGO Vision [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@argo.vision) to view them
and to be notified about the upcoming ones
(you also find the links in our homepage below the speaker photos, although they usually come out with some delays).

We also have some big news, we will have a âš¡Lightning Talkâš¡ session,
So the **next speaker can be YOU**!
Lightning talks are 5 minute talks that can have a wide variety of topics and
can be used to share about your activities or to explain a simple concept or
they are often used for humourous or creative takes on the topic of the conference.
How do I apply for Lightning Talks? Well, it could not be easier:
just come at the conference prepared to give a 5 minute talk,
and you will receive instructions at the beginning of the conference
on where to add it to the schedule (no reviews or approval needed)!

If you are looking for some inspiration you can find lightning talks on YouTube
for various Python and PyData conferences, just to make it easier for you here are
two fine specimens:
