The conference is less than 4 weeks away and we are really excited about it!
If you have your ticket you might already be making plans on how to reach the venue.
Here are some information that you might find useful.

To reach SEA Vision:

- ðŸš˜ If you're traveling by car: use a GPS navigation system or a mapping app to enter the address: [Via Treves 9E, 27100 Pavia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fdsrxd9fkM28oKtx7).
Follow the suggested route provided by the navigation system to reach the destination.
Parking spots are available in and around the venue.

- ðŸš† If you're using public transportation: use a transportation app or website to find routes to Pavia Station. Once you arrive in Pavia, you can take Bus no.7 (bus stop in front of the station), travel 12 stops without change, and you will arrive right in front of the venue (SEA Vision, Via Treves 9E).
Another option is to take a taxi from Pavia Station to SEA Vision (Via Treves 9E).
Ensure to check for any updates or changes to transportation routes before starting your journey.

- ðŸšŒ If you want to car share with other conference participants you can join
the newly created `#py4ai` channel in Python Milano Slack. Here is a [link](https://bit.ly/pymislack) to join Slack (you can find the same link at our easy-to-remember homepage [milano.python.it](milano.python.it)).

As an additional update, you might have noticed that we have started publishing
short video interviews of our wonderful speakers. To be notified first subscribe to
ARGO Vision [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@argo.vision) or [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/argo-vision/).

See you at #Py4AI!

**Note:**: We previously announced on our homepage that we wanted to provide a free shuttle
to the venue from Milan. Unfortunately we were not able to secure that option
and we apologize if you were counting on it.
