Dear AI & Python lovers,

exciting news! The Py4AI conference is just around the corner, and we couldn't be more thrilled to announce that, due to popular demand, we doubled the speakers (in 2 parallel tracks), and we are releasing a fresh batch of 100 tickets! Our conference has garnered attention from AI lovers, and it's no surprise that our initial ticket allocation sold out in record time. But fear not, for those who missed out on securing their spot, this is your chance to join us into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence & Python.

## How to Secure Your Ticket

We've unblocked the former waiting list for Py4AI conference tickets, granting those on the list (75 people) the tickets for this exceptional event! From now on, a **new unlimited** waiting list is open with the random assignation of tickets.  Details:

- until the 14th of February a brand new waiting list will be online for free registration;
- the 16th of February we will shuffle the waiting list and we will assign the remaining tickets (25) to the luckiest of you.

## New speakers

We added six new speakers to our great lineup. These experts bring a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field of artificial intelligence, and we couldn't be more excited to have them join us for what promises to be an exceptional event. The name of the speakers will be disclosed in the next days.
