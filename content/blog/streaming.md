Only one day from the the start of the conference
and we have a final announcement:
the talks will be streamed live during the event,
they will also be recorded and made available on our youtube channels.

Here is how it will work:
- on [SEA Vision Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SEAVisionGroup) we will stream the talks
from the Lounge room (see [program](../program/)).
The stream will start with the welcome to Py4AI talk around 9:45
and it will stop around 12:15 for a lunch break.
It will start again after the Lightning Talks around 14:45
and it will stop around 17:30 after the last talk.
- on [Python Milano Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pythonmilano/streams)
we will stream the talks from the Cardano room (see [program](../program/)).
The stream will start for the first talk around 10:00
and it will stop around 12:15 for a lunch break.
The talk on "Multi-agent autonomous flight" will NOT be
recorded nor streamed, so the streaming will start again in the
afternoon around 16:00 and end after the last talk around 17:30.

Lightning talks (see [schedule](../schedule/))
will not be streamed, but we might make them
available after the conference (if the speakers are ok with it).

For all attendees coming to Pavia,
be aware that tomorrow the cycling race Milano-Sanremo
will start from the city center around 10am and there might be additional traffic and some roads will be closed (see details [here](https://www.milanosanremo.it/percorso/)).
Make sure to start early and please come early for the registration if you can.

Remember also to check out [ARGO Vision YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@argo.vision) where we have published interviews to the speakers.
